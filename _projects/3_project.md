- **Category**: Software engineer internship
- **Year**: 2022
- **Location**: Evotrack, London, UK

My internship role is a software engineer focussing on data analysis and machine learning. My project encompassed a range of tasks, including leveraging Google Maps APIs for proximity analysis, generating diagnostic visuals for Paris charging station data, and deploying a station clustering algorithm.

A pivotal focus was training a gradient boosting regressor, forecasting charging station usage using historical data and facility density. During this project, I have developed excellent programming skills and machine learning knowledge by exploring all challenging tasks independently.
