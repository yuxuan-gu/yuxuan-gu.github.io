I was excited to join the New Yearâ€™s welcome party, where I had the chance to play the violin with my classmate. We worked closely together during rehearsals, exchanging our ideas, which helped me improve my teamwork and communication skills. Performing in front of a large audience boosted my confidence and was a great experience for my personal growth.
