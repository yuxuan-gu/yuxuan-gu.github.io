I am proud to have received the Cambridge Outstanding Learner Award for achieving the **highest score** in China across three subjects. Excelling in Physics, Further Mathematics (with a perfect score in Further Mechanics), and Chemistry has prepared me well for my future academic journey, boosting my confidence and fueling my curiosity to explore science more deeply. I am deeply grateful and excited to have been selected as a student representative and invited to deliver a speech in Shanghai. This opportunity highlights the importance of dedication and hard work in creating a meaningful educational journey.
